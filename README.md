# Homework 4
## Assignment 1
Assignment 1 deal with a molecular adsorption process. We cover a surface one atom at a time, with adsorption on each site random and independent on previous adsorptions. What is the distribution of atoms on the surface? How long does it take for the whole surface to be covered by at least one atom per site?
## Assignment 2-3
The second and third assignments deal with system composed by N independent and distinguishable particles that can be in either their ground state (with energy equal to 0) or their excited state (with energy equal to epsilon). 
In assignment 2 students will need to run a random sampling of microstates and compare the results for the average energy and the heat capacity as a function of tempearture with the corresponding analytic expressions.
In assignment 3 students will need to implement a Monte Carlo algorithm to sample configurations with the probability appropriate for the canonical ensemble at temperate T. How do importance sampling compare with the analytic results?
